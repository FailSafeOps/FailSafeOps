Just finished some learning for linux and some other things I have learned over the past few days, I learned how to:
Open and use the terminal.
Use basic commands: echo, whoami, id.
Install software (htop) using sudo apt install.
Monitor your system's performance using htop.
display user identity and detailed group information
Navigating the file system with cd and pwd
Creating files and directories with touch and mkdir
Listing contents with ls and its options
Copying files and directories with cp
Moving and renaming with mv
Removing files and directories with rm and rmdir
use cp for duplicating files and directories, mv for both moving and renaming them, and rm for removing them when they are no longer needed
use cat to view the entire contents of a file.
use cat -n to view file contents with line numbers.
use head to view the beginning of a file, both by lines and by bytes.
use tail to view the end of a file, both by lines and by bytes.
use diff to compare the contents of files.
use touch to create new files and update existing ones.
use chown to change file and directory ownership, including recursive changes for entire directory structures.
use chmod with both numeric and symbolic notation to modify file and directory permissions, understanding the different permission levels for owner, group, and others.
We saw practical examples of why permissions matter, such as needing execute permissions to run scripts.
We clarified the differences between numeric and symbolic notation for chmod and when each might be more appropriate.
Finally, you used diff -r to compare entire directories.
Create new user accounts
Set user passwords
Modify user properties like home directory and default shell
Add users to groups
Lock and unlock user accounts
Delete user accounts
