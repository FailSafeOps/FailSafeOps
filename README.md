FailSafeOps | Chad B.L.
Welcome to my GitHub profile. I’m building a brand rooted in operational realism, cybersecurity grit, and fitness discipline.

🤔 I’m looking for like minded people who want to grow and learn as I don't know very many people within my day to day life with the same mindset.
🌱 I’m currently learning on the sites tryhackme.com, freecodecamp.com and typing.com.
